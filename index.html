                <h2>My Dearest Manar,</h2>
                <p>It's your day, and yet all I can think about is how lucky I am that you exist. That out of all the people in this world, I found you — someone who makes my heart feel so full, so alive, that sometimes I wonder how I ever lived without you. Every message from you, every laugh we share, even the quiet moments when we're just there together — it all means more to me than words can say.</p>

                <p>I watched you grow into the incredible woman you are today, and somehow, against all odds, my heart has always known it was yours. Even during those times we drifted apart, even when life pulled us in different directions, something inside me was always waiting, always hoping we'd find our way back to each other. And we did. We always do.</p>
            
                <p>We don't need constant conversation to stay connected. Our hearts speak a language all their own — one that transcends distance, silence, and time. I feel you with me even when we're apart. I hear your voice in my thoughts even when we haven't spoken. And I carry your smile with me everywhere I go.</p>
            
                <p>I remember the days when we were kids, making promises about forever. I don't think I understood then what forever meant. But I do now. Forever is the way my heart recognizes yours. Forever is the certainty I feel when I think about us. Forever is knowing that no matter how many times we've lost our way, we've always found our path back to each other.</p>
            
                <p>There are moments when I catch myself staring at your photos, tracing the journey we've taken together — from those awkward childhood days to the beautiful complexity of what we share now. It amazes me how some things have changed so completely, while others — like the way my heart beats faster when I hear your name — have remained exactly the same.</p>
            
                <p>When I think about all the years we've known each other, all the moments we've shared, all the times we've fallen apart and come back together, I'm overwhelmed by how much of my life has been intertwined with yours. You're not just someone I love — you're part of who I am. You've shaped me, challenged me, inspired me in ways I probably don't even fully understand.</p>
            
                <p>Do you know you're the first person I want to talk to when something good happens? The only one who can truly comfort me when something breaks me? The voice I seek when my own thoughts become too loud? You've become my refuge, my safe place, my home — regardless of distance or circumstance.</p>
            
                <p>I know we've talked about the future. I know we've dreamed about what it'll be like when distance isn't between us anymore. But today, on your birthday, I want you to know something with absolute certainty: I am not going anywhere. No matter what obstacles come our way, no matter how hard things get, I will always choose you. Not because it's easy, but because you are worth every challenge, every sacrifice, every moment of waiting.</p>
            
                <p>Remember those nights when we stayed up until sunrise, talking about everything and nothing? The way the light slowly changed, painting the world in gold, as we shared our deepest fears and wildest dreams? In those moments, I knew. I knew that whatever life brought us, whatever storms we had to weather, there was nowhere else I'd rather be than by your side.</p>
            
                <p>I remember when we were young, how we used to imagine what our lives would be like when we grew up. I don't think either of us could have predicted this deep, unshakable bond that has survived everything life has thrown at us. But now I can't imagine any other path. You are woven into every dream I have, every plan I make, every prayer I whisper.</p>
            
                <p>There are days when the distance feels impossible. Days when I would give anything just to sit beside you, to see your face light up when you laugh, to hold your hand and feel that perfect sense of peace that comes only when we're together. On those days, I remind myself that what we share is worth the wait. That every moment apart is just bringing us closer to a lifetime together.</p>
            
                <p>I still get butterflies when your name appears on my phone. Still smile like an idiot when I think about you. Still find myself lost in daydreams about the life we'll build together. Isn't it beautiful that after all this time, after knowing each other since we were just kids, you still have that effect on me? Some things never change, and my love for you is one of them.</p>
            
                <p>I think about how you've seen me at my worst and loved me anyway, how you know all my flaws and still choose me, how you understand me in ways no one else ever has. There's a freedom in being truly known, truly accepted. With you, I never have to pretend. I never have to be anyone but exactly who I am. And you love me not despite my imperfections, but somehow, miraculously, with them included in the package.</p>
            
                <p>The truth is, Manar, you're the only person who has ever made me feel like I'm home just by being near you. And that feeling — that sense of belonging, of rightness — has never faded, not once in all the years we've known each other.</p>
            
                <p>There are moments when I catch myself wondering what I did to deserve you. How, out of all the paths I could have taken, I found the one that led me to you. Sometimes it feels like more than luck — like something bigger than both of us has been guiding us toward each other from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>I pray for the day I can wake up next to you. The day I can hold your hand in mine and feel like the luckiest person alive just because you're by my side. I pray for the day I get to call you my wife not just in secret whispers, but in front of the whole world. Because Manar, you are everything to me. You're the reason I believe in love that lasts, in fights worth having, in a future worth waiting for.</p>

                <p>When I close my eyes and picture my life years from now, it's always your face I see beside me. Your laugh echoing through our home. Your hand in mine as we face whatever comes our way. I don't just want the big moments — the wedding, the milestones, the celebrations. I want the quiet Tuesdays. The mundane mornings. The ordinary days made extraordinary simply because we're spending them together.</p>
                
                <p>I imagine us growing old together, watching the years change us, strengthen us, deepen our connection. I imagine looking at you decades from now and still seeing the girl I fell in love with. Because that's the thing about real love, isn't it? It sees beyond the surface, beyond the physical, to the essence of who we are. And your essence, Manar, is the most beautiful thing I've ever known.</p>
                
                <p>I know it hasn't always been easy. I know there have been times when the distance felt too great, when the obstacles seemed insurmountable, when we didn't talk as much as we should have. But through it all, my heart has remained steadfast. My love for you has never wavered. And my belief in us — in what we have and what we will be — has only grown stronger with each passing day.</p>
                
                <p>There have been moments when I've felt like the whole world was against us. When every path forward seemed blocked. When the future we dreamed of felt impossibly out of reach. In those moments, it was the thought of your smile that kept me going. The memory of your voice saying my name. The unshakable certainty that a love like ours is worth fighting for, no matter how difficult the battle.</p>
                
                <p>I've never told you this, but sometimes when we're talking, I close my eyes and pretend you're right beside me. I imagine the weight of your head on my shoulder, the sound of your breathing, the warmth of your hand in mine. It's in those moments that distance disappears, that the boundaries between us dissolve, and I feel closer to you than to anyone else in the world.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I wonder if you know just how deeply you're loved. If you understand the extent to which you've changed my life. If you can feel, even from a distance, how completely my heart belongs to you. I hope you do. I hope that on days when you feel alone, when the world seems too heavy, when doubts creep in, you can feel my love surrounding you, holding you, reminding you that you are never truly alone.</p>
                
                <p>There is a certain kind of magic in finding someone who sees all the parts of you — the light and the shadow, the strength and the weakness — and chooses to love it all. You've done that for me, Manar. You've seen me wholly, completely, and still decided I was worth loving. I promise to spend every day of my life trying to be worthy of that gift.</p>
                
                <p>I love the way your eyes light up when you talk about things you're passionate about. The way your whole face transforms, radiating a kind of inner light that takes my breath away. I love watching you in those moments, seeing the pure, unfiltered you shining through. It reminds me of why I fell in love with you in the first place — because your soul speaks to mine in a language only we understand.</p>
                
                <p>I know we can't be together today the way I wish we could. But I hope you feel my love in every word I send you, in every stupid joke I make just to make you laugh, in every late night conversation where we forget about time. I hope you know that even when we're apart, my heart is yours. Completely. Unconditionally.</p>
                
                <p>When I say I love you, I don't just mean I love the easy parts — the smiles, the laughter, the good times. I mean I love all of you. The fears, the doubts, the struggles. The parts you show the world and the parts you hide away. The person you are now and the person you're still becoming. I love the whole, complex, beautiful reality of you.</p>
                
                <p>Every birthday we've celebrated — together or apart — has been a reminder of how grateful I am that you were born, that you exist, that somehow, in this vast universe, our paths crossed and our lives became forever entwined. Today is no different. Today, I celebrate not just another year of your life, but everything you are, everything you've been to me, everything we've shared since we were just kids with no idea of the journey ahead.</p>
                
                <p>Have you ever thought about how many moments have led us here? How many choices, how many chances, how many seemingly random events had to align perfectly for us to find each other? Sometimes the mathematical improbability of it all overwhelms me. Out of all the people in the world, we found each other. And not just once, but over and over again, through all the years, all the changes, all the growing up and growing apart and finding our way back.</p>
                
                <p>I want to give you the world, Manar. I want to show you places you've never seen, help you experience things you've only dreamed of, be beside you as you accomplish everything you've ever wanted. But more than that, I want to give you a love that feels like home. A love that's as comfortable as it is exciting. A love that's both a safe harbor and an adventure. A love that withstands the test of time.</p>
                
                <p>They say that when you truly love someone, you want their happiness even more than your own. I never really understood that until you. Now I know that your joy is my joy. Your pain is my pain. Your dreams are my dreams. We're connected in a way that transcends physical distance, that defies logical explanation. Two souls that recognize each other across time and space.</p>
                
                <p>When you close your eyes tonight, know that I'm here, thinking of you, loving you, and counting the days until I can tell you all of this in person, holding you close and never letting go.</p>
                
                <p>They say love is a choice — a decision you make every day to stand by someone no matter what. But with you, it's never felt like a choice. Loving you is as natural as breathing, as inevitable as the sunrise. I couldn't stop if I tried. And I never, ever want to try.</p>
                
                <p>I believe that some souls are meant to find each other, no matter how many lifetimes it takes. In this one, I found you. And I intend to keep finding you, choosing you, loving you today, tomorrow, and for all the days that follow. Until forever runs out, and then some more after that.</p>
                
                <p>Do you remember that promise we made to each other? That no matter what life throws our way, we'll face it together? I'm still keeping that promise. I always will. There is nothing — nothing — that could make me walk away from what we have. Some things are worth fighting for, worth waiting for, worth sacrificing for. You are at the top of that list.</p>
                
                <p>I've loved you in a thousand different ways over the years we've known each other. As a friend, as a confidant, as the keeper of my secrets and the holder of my heart. But the way I love you now — completely, wholly, with every fiber of my being — this is my favorite way. And I know that years from now, when we're together at last, I'll find yet another way to love you even more.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Happy Birthday, Manar.</strong> Not just today, but every day, I am here. I am yours. And no matter how long it takes, I will spend the rest of my life making sure you never doubt how much you mean to me.</p>
                
                <p><em>Always and forever yours ♥️</em></p>
